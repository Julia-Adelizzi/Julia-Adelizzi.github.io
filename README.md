## About Me
My name is Julia Adelizzi. I am a sophomore at Lehigh University studying journalism and marketing. I am from Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where I live with my two older sisters and my mom and dad. We have lived here my entire life. I spend my summers in Ocean City, New Jersey, which is my favorite place to be. I am interested in storytelling, videography and traveling but also bringing light to local stories and communities.
